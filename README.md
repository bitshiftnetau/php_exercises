## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to illustrate a basic level of competency in the PHP
language and to accompany the blog posts made on bitshift.net.au, which the author
hopes will serve the community of novice programmers and therefore the greater
software community.

So far, there are several projects dealing with basic concepts like functions,
conditionals, switch-case, jump-tables, associative arrays, and so on...

Moving forward, these projects will grow in complexity to further illustrate a
growth in understanding and application of the PHP programming language.

The author invites anyone to participate in studying and applying the concepts
illustrated in these projects and to make contact if needing assistance, even
if the assistance pertains to material outside of this repo.

However, the author would like to gently remind participants to take extra time
in understanding the concepts, even when they do not initially seem obvious. It
will take time to grok. Students taking that time, so as to respect the author's,
will receive the most fruitful outcome and positive feedback.

In the event of contact, please illustrate the problem in detail with listed
attempts, error outputs and logs, system information (including what have installed
and configured i.e. apache, php, mysql, any firewall info if you are on a network,
etc), and allow a few days for the author to respond.

Happy Coding!!! :)
